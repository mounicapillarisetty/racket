;;Exercise 8

;;Recursive process. Need to implement as an iterative process.

(define (identity x) x)

;;iterative procedure?
(define (sum fn a next b)
 (sum-iter fn a next b 0))

(define(sum-iter fn a next b result)
  (if (> a b)
      result
      (sum-iter fn (next a) next b (+ (fn a) result))))


(define (sum-integers a b)
  (sum identity a increment b))

(sum-integers 1 5)
